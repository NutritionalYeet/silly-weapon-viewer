# Silly Weapon Viewer

A simple app that allows you to view items from a local server.

## To use

In the console, change directory to the React project folder and enter npm start.

The app generates some placeholder weapons to demonstrate the visual components.

The PHP code and SQL to generate the sample database is in the folder, "php and sql."

Place the PHP file into your htdocs folder (this project assumes you are using XAMPP).
