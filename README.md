# Silly Weapon Viewer

A simple React app that allows you to view items from a local server.

## To use

CD to project directory > npm start

The app generates some placeholder weapons to demonstrate the visual components.

The PHP code and SQL to generate the sample database is in the folder, "php and sql." Place the PHP file into your htdocs folder (this project assumes you are using XAMPP / Apache). Both the web server and database server need to be running.
