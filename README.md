# Silly Weapon Viewer

A simple React app that allows you to view items from a local server.

## To use

CD to project directory > npm start (might need to use npm install first)

The app generates some placeholder weapons to demonstrate the visual components. It works best when run in Chrome.

The PHP code and SQL to generate the sample database is in the folder, "php and sql." Place the PHP file into your htdocs folder (this project assumes you are using XAMPP / Apache). Adjust the SQL query in the php file as necessary (set to LIMIT 100 by default). Both the web server and database server need to be running.
